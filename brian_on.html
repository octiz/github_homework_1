<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Brian On. I was born in Brantford, Ontario on May 2, 1999. I am currently 21 years of age and my goal is to pursue a career where I can express my own creativity and ideas. I am the second generation of my family as my parents moved here back in 1989 to start a family with a better life in Canada. </p>

<p>I am currently student at Fanshawe College pursuing my Interactive Media Design diploma in IDP3. I'd like to consider myself a very adventourous person who loves to express their ideas in the form of digital artwork. This is my third year studying at Fanshawe College after completing my business marketing diploma last year. In the end, I switched programs to help further my skillset in other aspects that I could see correlating in my career path. I believe the skills and knowledge that I learn from the IDP3	course can help showcase my marketing understanding through my own visuals and work. Currently, I am also working a part-time job at Coco's bubble tea. This is just to earn some extra cash while I am in school as well as with all the time.</p>
