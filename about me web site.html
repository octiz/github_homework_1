<h2 style="color: white">About me</h2>

<p style="color: white"> Hi, I'm Artem) and I hate to write about myself. I am from Kyiv Ukraine. I am 19 years old I have 2 dogs, a ferret and 1 younger brother ( he is like an animal too, but I love him.) Also, I'm a big fan of all extreme sports activities. I am riding a motorcycle (enduro) since I'm 7 years old and it is my main hobby, often during summer holidays me and my father are traveling around Ukraine on motorbikes. Also, I took third place in Kyiv in snowboarding and I am a big fan of tattoos and piercing. I really enjoy working with hands like making knives, tools or wooden furnuture. Also, me and my father have a hobby we are cudtomizing and restoring old soviet motocycles and then selling them. Besides all of that i'm a big fan of old glam rock music and video/photography, I have video blog on tik tok with almost 200k subsribers.
So, this is a short essay about me))
